- Once you are done with the coding session push that folder to the online repo. 

**React (Part 1)**

**NOTE:** Follow the instructions carefully and follow coding discipline

**NOTE2:** Indent your code correctly and stick to one kind of naming style

**NOTE3:** You have to write all your code within the `script` tag in the html file. 

A template file called `template.html` is given to you here [https://github.com/masai-school/full-stack-dev/blob/master/course/week_6/day_3/session1/template.html]https://github.com/masai-school/full-stack-dev/blob/master/course/week_6/day_3/session1/template.html). 

For each part of this coding session you must make a copy of that template file and rename it. The filenames will be given in each part. You could either copy this file's contents or you could pull/clone the full-stack-dev repository and copy the file and rename it. 

### FSD.W6.3.1_1
