## FSD.W2.3.A (1 Hour)

Your task today is to create a unit converter web application!

Visit this link [https://www.unitconverters.net/](https://www.unitconverters.net/) to get an idea of what your final result should look like. 

While the above converter has many units and conversions you just have to implement the following units and conversions: 

### Length

1. Meter
2. Kilometer  
3. Mile
4. Light Year

### Temperature 

1. Celsius 
2. Kelvin 
3. Fahrenheit 

### Volume 

1. Liter
2. Milliliter  
2. US Gallon 
3. Imperial Tea Spoon

**Your converter must be able to convert from any unit to any other unit. Eg: Meter to Kilometer, Kelvin to Celsius etc.**

## HTML Elements you must use:

1. A text input for the user to enter the **amount** of a given unit. 

2. A element for the **output** of the conversion.

3. A select element for the **From** unit. 

4. A select element for the **To** unit. 

5. A an input element to select the **Type** of unit. Eg: Length, Temperature etc.

6. A **button** with the text `Convert`

## Functionality

1. A user must be able to select a **From** unit, a **To** unit and a **Type**. Eg: Liter, US Gallon, Volume.

2. When the `Convert` button is clicked the **Output** must show the converted result and unit. Eg: 1 liter to 0.2641721769 US Gallons

3. Your output must clearly indicate the output unit. Eg: Meter, Celsius Etc.

4. You cannot convert between incorrect types. For example you cannot convert between meter and liter! Give the user a warning message in the output or alert if incorrect units are selected!

5. If you are able to complete the above steps, then test for bugs and handle them gracefully. Eg: If user inputs alphabets or special characters you must give an error output. 

**Note:** You can use any HTML tags for the above elements but it must perform the same basic function as mentioned above. 

**Note2:** If you were able to complete the basic project, use CSS to make your web page look professional and add more functionality!
