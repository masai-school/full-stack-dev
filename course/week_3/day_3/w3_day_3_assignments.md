  - Once the button `ENTER` is pressed the score gets compared with the `MIN` and `MAX` boxes, if the current score is less than the `MIN` score it gets updated with the current score, if the current score is greater than the `MAX` score it gets updated with the current score. The `TOTAL` score will gets updated with the sum of all scores

  - By clicking the `REMOVE ODD` button all the scores with the odd game numbers `Game 1`  `Game 3` and so on should be removed from the score card, the `MIN` `MAX` and `TOTALS` updated accordingly and the new game numbers should be assigned again like `Game 2` will now become `Game 1`
  - By clicking the `REMOVE EVEN` button all the scores with the even game numbers `Game 2`  `Game 4` and so on should be removed from the score card, the `MIN` `MAX` and `TOTALS` updated accordingly and the new game numbers should be assigned again like `Game 3` will now become `Game 2`
