# Week 9 - Day 1

#### Coding 1


**SUBMISSION:**

- You must update the Day 1 project with new features. 

**React Router 2**


**NOTE:** Follow the instructions carefully and follow coding discipline

**NOTE2:** Indent your code correctly and stick to one kind of naming style

**NOTE3:** All components must be in different files and within a `Components`folder. CSS can be shared between components if desired. CSS modules must also be in your components folder. 

**NOTE4:** All static files like images must be in the public folder.

**NOTE5:** All components files must have the same name as their components. Eg: `App` must be in `App.js`.

**NOTE6:** You must only call `ReactDOM.render` once in your index.js file! 

**NOTE7**: Commit your code to your remote branch regularly and meaningfully.(Don't commit to master!) This can help you manage your project during development in case you need to return to any old code. 

**NOTE**: Do not write all your code within a single component!

Within the react App delete all files from the src folder and create your own files!

## Learning objectives:
- Basic Routing with React Router
- Building a Scalable Application

## Final Goal

This will be a multi-part project spanning across the next few days. Your final objective will be to create a mock E-Commerce website similar to these [https://www.shopify.com/blog/shopify-stores](https://www.shopify.com/blog/shopify-stores).

As we continue to learn more about React Router should be implementing new features. 

For inspiration on your design take a look at these websites:

-  [https://www.tannergoods.com/](https://www.tannergoods.com/)
- [https://hauslondon.com/](https://hauslondon.com/)
- [https://www.studioproper.com/](https://www.studioproper.com/)
- [https://www.apple.com/](https://www.apple.com/)


## Minimum Viable Product

MVP or minimum viable product is the least amount of functionality you must have done by the end of today.

Your task today is to update yesterdays shopping Application with some new features. 

- [ ] Add some products pages to your Application, the data for this can be some dummy JSON data from a file in Public. Also add placeholder images for each product. You can use [https://placeimg.com/](https://placeimg.com/) to generate these images. 
- [ ] When a product from the products pages is clicked, the application must take the user to a custom product page where the user can see more information about a product. This product page must also give the user a `Add to Cart` button.
- [ ] If any invalid route/path is visited, you must display a 404 not found page.
